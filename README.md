# CANbus

Nowadays, quadruped robots are used popularly in Agriculture, Construction, Military, 
Security and monitoring, Law enforcement, Search and rescue operations because of its 
ability to move in difficult terrain conditions. They can climb, step, and crawl, making them 
well-suited for unstructured environments. Bash on Mini Cheetah all actuators communicate 
over a single CAN-bus. This project attempts to study how a single CAN-bus communicate 
with Odrive to motor control using python script. However, CAN is convenient for its simple 
and robust Physical Layer (PHY) that requires only a twisted pair of wires and a 120ohm 
termination resistor at each end. It has low jitter and low latency, because there is no host 
computer. It is relatively fast (CAN 2.0b supports 1 Mbps). Messages are easy to configure 
and load with data. Transceivers and controllers are inexpensive and widely available, thanks 
to its use in automotive.
